      "The perfect chocolate chip cookie is absolutely a science. You can experiment for weeks, or months, or years to find your perfect version. These Ultimate Chocolate Chip Cookies are the product of plenty of trial and error, resulting in one of Bettys best. If you dont trust us telling you that our recipe is one of the best, you can check out the hundreds of positive reviews!  After you master this recipe, feel free to do a little of your own experimenting to make these your ultimate cookie. Try substituting the semisweet chocolate chips for a combination of white chocolate chips, milk chocolate chips, butterscotch chips and/or peanut butter chips. Its hard to go wrong with this fantastic recipe as a guide.  Tip: To ensure your cookies dont spread into each other while baking, make sure not to crowd the baking sheet. The scoops of chocolate chip cookie dough should be at least 2 inches apart from each other, so its totally normal to only have six cookies on each cookie sheet. You do not need to grease the cookie sheet, but lining the sheet with parchment paper makes it easier to clean up after your baking adventures.",
